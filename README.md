# 👋 Hi, I'm Yash Patel

Welcome to my data science and analytics portfolio! I specialize in turning complex datasets into actionable insights and building predictive models to solve real-world problems. With hands-on experience across the full data pipeline — from exploration to deployment — I bring both technical expertise and business acumen to every project I work on.
